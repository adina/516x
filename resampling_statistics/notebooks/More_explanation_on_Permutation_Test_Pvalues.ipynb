To do that, we count the number of test-statistics as or more extreme than our initially observed test statistic, and divide that number by the total number of permutation test-statistics we calculated. The direction ($>$ or $<$ than the observed test statistic) of \"as or more extreme\" needs to be determined by the hypothesis."

This is a test with **two-sided** alternative hypothesis. When calculating the p-value, we want to count all the permuted test statistics (Ts) that are greater than the abosolute value of the observed Ts, and also those that are smaller than the negative value of the abosolute value of the observed Ts.
